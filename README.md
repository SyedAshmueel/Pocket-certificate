# Pocket-certificate
Pocket certificate using double encryption by combined cryptography


 The Pocket Certificates System is software that attempts to encrypt the authenticity of government-
issued documents like as Aadhaar cards and PAN cards. In order to secure our programme, we employ a

combination of cryptography techniques (for example, AES, DES, and RSA). The main purpose of Pocket
Certificates is to give users the flexibility of passing information while implementing encryption standards
according to the specification and algorithms proposed, storing information in an encrypted form that is
unreadable, and making documents available on their private accounts. Whenever a user requests a file, the
system decrypts the document stored on the server. The entire programme will feature a user-friendly
Graphical User Interface that will allow the end user to learn on their own. The system will meet all functional
requirements for proper navigation.
